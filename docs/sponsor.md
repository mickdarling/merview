## About the Developer

Hi! I'm **Mick Darling**. I've spent nearly two decades in tech across media, biotech, and IT. I hold four patents in natural language processing and believe deeply in open source.

Merview started as a tool I built to help with [DollhouseMCP](https://github.com/mickdarling/DollhouseMCP), an MCP server for managing AI personas and skills. I needed a better way to write and preview documentation with embedded Mermaid diagrams, so I built this. It turned out to be genuinely useful, so I'm sharing it.

Your sponsorship helps me dedicate more time to open source projects like this.
